I"½<p>Trying to restore a TimeMachine Backup of a <em>HFS+</em> formatted macOS disk on a Mac that had previously installed High Sierra and thereby has its disk converted to the new <em>APFS</em>, results in an error and put the Mac into an unusable state.</p>

<p>The problem is that the High Sierra Installer Mode doesnâ€™t support non-APFS base TimeMachine backups (but doesnâ€™t warn about it either).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: This doesnâ€™t refer to the backup-disk itself, but to the filesystem of the source operating system!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The solution is rather complicated and time consuming because it requires to install the originating <em>OS X</em> version of the Mac (the one it was shipped with), but itâ€™s the only way to restore a TimeMachine backup in that scenario:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Press <code class="highlighter-rouge">command</code> + <code class="highlighter-rouge">option</code> + <code class="highlighter-rouge">r</code> while booting to enter <strong>Internet Recovery Mode</strong>.</li>
  <li>Install the MacBookâ€™s originally shipped version of <strong>OS X</strong>.</li>
  <li>Reboot and press <code class="highlighter-rouge">command</code> + <code class="highlighter-rouge">r</code> while booting to enter <strong>Installer Mode</strong>.</li>
  <li>Restore from TimeMachine Backup.</li>
</ol>

<p>This works, because the older Installer Mode supported TimeMachine Backups of HFS+ formatted disks.</p>
